   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantraval3011/naturalist.git

## How It Works
Naturalist leverages **GSAP** for smooth animations, creating a dynamic and interactive product showcase. By combining GSAP with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site provides a seamless, polished experience.
- The animations are triggered on scroll and hover events, making the website more interactive.
- The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive design.

## Customization
You can customize the following parts of the project:
- **Product Images**: Replace the current images in the `images` folder with your own products.
- **Animations**: Modify the GSAP animations by adjusting the duration, easing, and timing in the JavaScript code.
- **Styles**: Change the appearance of the website by modifying the CSS in `styles.css`.
